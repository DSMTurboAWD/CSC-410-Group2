                    <p>Advanced students at American Karate Studios are called upon to take on the role of assistants to the head instructors. It is their duty to pass on the knowledge they have acquired to a young base of students who look up to them. Advanced students will engage in intricate forms, belt training, complex weaponry, competition, and above all, lessons that will apply to their success in all facets of their personal and professional lives.</p>
